# TerrainAlign

 Examples of Terrain Alignment for Unity. It's just a prototype for toying around. It works by projection of gameobjects on the terrain and then blending thet projection with the heightmap.
 Currently the projection works with a camera that's the full terrain size. Of course one would only project the gameobject itself or only delta changes in case of a road, but that'll come at a later state while this tool evolves.
 
 I put it on github for educational purposes in case someone wants to toy around.
 
 Important: 
 This is only experimental so far, install into a new project or backup your terrain!
